# Plasma Display IoT

Same as [this project](https://github.com/entozoon/plasma-matrix-display-mc6205) but with IoT capability.

## Usage

Save `Conf.h.example` in lib to `Conf.h` and populate.

### API

Please note: The API that I personally use is mine and mine alone - you'll want to roll your own.

However, I can describe what you want it to provide - which is literally just the text to display on the screen. i.e. a 16x10 string:

    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
