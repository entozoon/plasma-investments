### API

Please note: The API that I personally use is mine and mine alone - you'll want to roll your own.

However, I can describe what you want it to provide - which is literally the text to display on the screen. i.e. a 16x10 string:

    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
    Hello world.....
